MrAutomatic is an automation app that aims to save you time and convenience you in any way it can.
The app can set profiles the user has described base on its surroundings. It relies on the following sensors/devices :
    1. BATTERY TEMPERATURE
    2. BATTERY LEVEL
    3. BLUETOOTH
    4. WIFI
    5. APP LAUNCHES *
    6. LOCATION (GPS) *
    7. TIME AND DATE *
    8. DOCK
    9. EARPHONE JACK
    10.NFC *
    11.SMS *
It uses those devices to determine which profile to set. Profiles can control the following :
     1. WIFI
     2. BLUETOOTH
     3. DATA *
     4. BRIGHTNESS
     5. AIRPLANE *
     6. SILENT MODE
     7. NOTIFICATION VOLUME
     8. MEDIA VOLUME
     9. RINGER VOLUME
     10.ACCOUNT SYNC *
     11.AUTO ROTATION
     12.SLEEP TIMEOUT
     13.WALLPAPER *
     14.RINGTONE *
     15.LAUNCH APP
     16.MEDIA (PAUSE,PLAY OR STOP MUSIC OR VIDEO) *
     17.ALARM VOLUME
Note items with an astrix(*) next to them are partially implemented and will be done soon
Note preferences are still not implemented yet
More triggers and settings/actions may be added later provided there is a lot of user interest on the respective idea.
