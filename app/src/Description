The app can set profiles the user has described base on its surroundings. It relies on the following sensors/devices:
    1. Battery temperature
    2. Battery level
    3. Bluetooth
    4. Wifi
    5. App Launch *
    6. Location (GPS) *
    7. Time and date *
    8. Dock
    9. Ear/Headphone Jack
    10.NFC *
    11.SMS *
It uses those devices to determine which profile to set. Profiles can control the following:
    1. Bluetooth
    2. Wifi
     3. Data *
     4. Brightness
     5. Airplane Mode *
     6. Silent Mode
     7. Notifications Volume
     8. Media Volume
     9. Ringer Volume
     10. Alarm Volume
     11.Auto Rotation
     12.Sleep Timeout
     13.Wallpaper *
     14.Ringtone *
