## Mr Automatic
An android app that allows you to carry out actions based on the state of you device.

**It takes in:**
-Battery (level / charging state / temperature)
-Location/GPS
-Connected Wifi/Bluetooth devices
-Detected device (NFC, Dock, Headphone Jack)
-Time
-App launch
**Then if the conditions you set are met, it can carry out these actions:**
-Change most settings (brightness, media volume, notification volume and alarm volume),  bluetooth, Wifi, NFC, Data, GPS , Wallpaper etc.
-Toggle music playback (only really usefull with bluetooth and Wifi if you have smart speakers)
-Launch app
*Note it used to work, but with the new versions of android settings and certain data has been getting more and more restricted to protect people from apps that abuse their access. App is mostly useless on the latest version of android, but if you have an old device you can run it there*
